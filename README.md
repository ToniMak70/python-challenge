# python-challenge 
For the PyBank challenge I was tasked to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
        *The total number of months included in the dataset
        *The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
        *The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
        *The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
        *The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
                Here are the results of the PyBank challenge:
                        Total Months: 86
                        Total: $22564198
                        Average Change: $-8311.11
                        Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 $1862002
                        Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 $-1825558


For the PyPoll challenge I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process by creating a python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
        *The total number of votes cast
        *A complete list of candidates who received votes
        *The percentage of votes each candidate won
        *The total number of votes each candidate won
        *The winner of the election based on popular vote
                Here are the results of PyPoll challenge:
